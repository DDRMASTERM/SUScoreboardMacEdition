This is a (mostly) direct adaptation for Mac computers, coded from the ground-up in XCode with (what should be) the same functionality for a Mac Computer. 
As this is the initial upload and I am still very much a programming amatuer, bugs may occur that I have overlooked. If you find any I missed, let me know
and I will see if I can fix them.

Setup should (hopefully) be minimal. Start by selecting the folder where you will want the files to be saved, and from there it will start creating files
in the chosen folder after clicking update. Additional functions like sponsors, twitters, commentators, and flags for teams may be selected from options menu.

This project is open source, so if you wish to add or change any functions manually, feel free.
