This is a (mostly) direct adaptation for Mac computers, coded from the ground-up in XCode with (what should be) the same functionality for a Mac Computer. 
As this is the initial upload and I am still very much a programming amatuer, bugs may occur that I have overlooked. If you find any I missed, let me know
and I will see if I can fix them.
